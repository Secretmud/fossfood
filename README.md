# fossfood
Free and open-source platform for recipes, written in PHP and HTML/CSS.

## Test locally

If you do not have a PHP-friendly web server set up, you can serve the
project locally like this:

```bash
cd src
php -S localhost:8080
```

This will let you browse the project in your browser (or through other
means) by visiting the address ``localhost:8080``.

## Contribute recipes?

Use basic Markdown syntax like # and ##.  To display the date of
creation, use DATE: YYYY-MM-DD

Start the document with the name of the dish or the drink you want to
contribute.  Add measurements where they apply, followed by the
directions.
